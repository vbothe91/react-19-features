# react-19-features
As a part of this repository we will add all the react 19 features with practical implementation

1. React Compiler (React 19 optimisation with useCallback, useMemo and React.memo())
2. Ref and ForwardRef (With React 19 forwardRef is no more needed)
3. React Context (React 19 context improvements)
4. React Form Actions (useActionState)
